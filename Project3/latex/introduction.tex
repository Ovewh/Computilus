When solving 

Integrating a function... More often than not the integral is to complex or not
possible to easily solve with traditional analytic methods. When faced with
these kind of integrals, numerical integration (also called quadrature) is our
best option.

When first introduced to numerical integration, one might see the trapezoidal
rule, the midpoint or the Simpson's rule. These are all examples of
Newton-Cotes integration formulas. While these kind of methods is easy to
intuitively understand (in case of the trapezoidal rule the area under the curve
is approximated by adding together many trapezoids), they are usually not the
best when it comes to accuracy and efficiency. This is especially true for
higher dimensional integrals where the Newton-Cotes quadrature becomes highly
inefficient.   

A group of methods commonly used for solving higher dimensional which is called
Monte Carlo methods (named after Monaco's famous casino district). Our aim is to
demonstrate Monte Carlo integration, which we think
