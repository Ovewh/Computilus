\section*{Abstract}

We investigate two different approachs to evaluating multi dimensional
integrals. The first is gaussian quadrature with both Legendre and Laguerre
polynomials. The second is Monte-Carlo integration, first taking a brute force
approach, and then using importance sampling to decrease the variance.
We found that....
