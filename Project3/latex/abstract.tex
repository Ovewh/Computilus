\section*{Abstract}
This work aims to evaluate Monte Carlo Integration (MCI) for solving physical
problems with many degrees of freedom. The physical problem in question is
the ground state correlation energy between two electrons in a helium atom,
which we solved using four different approaches, "brute force" MCI, MCI with
importance sampling, Gaussian Quadrature (GQ) with Legendre polynomials and GQ
combining Legendre- and Laguerre polynomials. We did an extensive analysis of the error,
CPU time and scalability of the different approaches. The result of our
analysis showed that...
