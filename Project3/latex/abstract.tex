\section*{Abstract}
This work aims to evaluate Monte Carlo Integration (MCI) for solving physical
problems with many degrees of freedom. The physical problem we in question is
the ground state correlation energy between two electrons in a helium atom,
which we computed using four different approaches, "brute force" MCI, MCI with
importance sampling, Gaussian Quadrature (GQ) with Legendre polynomials and GQ
combining Legendre and Laguerre. We did an extensive comparison of the error,
CPU time and scalability of the different approaches. The result of our
comparison showed that...
