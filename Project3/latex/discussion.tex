\section{Discussion}
The result from our analysis clearly favours MCI, particularly when
given more cpu time. The GQ approach did not benefit significantly with
increased 
CPU time after a certain point, the sweet spot for GQ Laguerre being 14
integration points. Regardless we would not disregard using GQ, since the
accuracy of the method is very much dependent on the problem being evaluated.
In comparison MCI would behave more or less the same regardless of the physical
problem, since the standard deviation would still follow \cref{eq: std}. 

Still we think this experiment did provide some insight into the kind situations where
these two very different approaches would be best suited. For instance if the
physical problem has many degrees of freedom $\nu \ge 6 $, then MCI would most
likely yield the best result.    

Another point to be made based on our results is the potential huge benefits
from parallelization depending on how many cpu cores at your disposal. Combine
this with current increase and availability of multicore processors, making a
even stronger case for MCI.
