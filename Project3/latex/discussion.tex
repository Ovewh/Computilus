\section{Discussion}
The result from our analysis clear show the benefits of MCI, particularly when
given more cpu time. As the GQ approach more or less did not benefit for more
CPU time after a certain point, the sweet spot for GQ Laguerre being 14
integration points. Regardless we would not disregard using GQ, since the
accuracy of the method is very much dependent on the problem we are evaluating.
In comparison MCI which behave more or less the same regardless of the physical
problem, since the standard deviation would still follow [ref som eq]. Still we
think that our experiment yielded some insight into the kind situations where
these two very different approaches would be best suited. For instance if the
physical problem has many degrees of freedom $\nu \ge 6 $, then MCI would most
likely yield the best result.
