\section{Introduction}
Rossby waves was first described by the Swedish meteorologist Carl G Rossby
\parencite{Rossby1939}. Rossby waves exist due to the latitudinal variation in
the Coriolis acceleration, where it is largest at the high latitude and zero at
equator. The varying Coriolis acceleration changes the vorticity of a fluid
parcels as if they moves to different latitudes. 

In this work we will look at Rossby waves in a greatly simplified barotropic 
atmosphere/ocean. In this simplified barotropic world the density depends only
on pressure, which via the ideal gas law holds that the temperature is constant
on a isobaric surface. We also assume the flow to be frictionless and
non-divergent, meaning no vertical velocities.
