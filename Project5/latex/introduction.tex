\section{Introduction}
Rossby waves was first described by the Swedish meteorologist Carl G Rossby
\parencite{Rossby1939}. Rossby waves exist due to the latitudinal variation in
the Coriolis acceleration, where it is largest at the high latitude and zero at
equator. The varying Coriolis acceleration changes the vorticity of a fluid
parcels as if they moves to different latitudes.
