\section{Introduction}
Rossby waves was first described by the Swedish meteorologist Carl G Rossby
\parencite{Rossby1939}. Rossby waves exist due to the latitudinal variation in
the Coriolis acceleration, where it is largest at the high latitude and zero at
equator. The varying Coriolis acceleration changes the vorticity of fluid
parcels as they moves to different latitudes. Rossby waves have scales of
hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Rossby waves play a major role in dictating
the weather on daily and large time scales and are crucial for the meridional
transport of heat, moisture and momentum \parencite{midSynDyn}.  

This study will consider Rossby waves in a greatly simplified 
atmosphere/ocean. We will assume that our atmosphere/ocean is barotropic the
density depends only on pressure, which via the ideal gas law holds that the
temperature is constant
on a isobaric surface. We also assume the flow to be frictionless and
non-divergent, consequently neglecting vertical velocities. Under these
simplifications the quasi geostrophic vorticity equation is reduced to
\cref{eq:QG_vorticity}, where $\zeta$ is the relative vorticity and $f$ is the
planetary vorticity. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:QG_vorticity}
    \frac{D(\zeta + f)}{Dt} = 0
\end{equation}
From \cref{eq:QG_vorticity} we also have the absolute vorticity
($\zeta + f$) being conserved following the flow. If a fluid parcel is moving
poleward towards region of larger $f$ then, there must be a compensating change
in $\zeta$ for order to keep the absolute vorticity unchanged. This balancing
act between planetary and relative vorticity is the essential mechanism behind
Rossby waves, demonstrating that even in this simplified form the dynamical
essence of the Rossby waves is retained. We will derive the barotropic Rossby
wave equation (BRWQ) in the subsequent section.

In the numerical study we will solve the BRWQ in both one and two dimension
using both the forward difference and central difference scheme. We will provide
a an extensive overview of our algorithm and evaluate the accuracy and stability
of the two numerical schemes.
