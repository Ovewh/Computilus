\section{Conclusion}
In this study we examined the barotropic rossby wave equation (BRWE), first we derived
the barotropic wave equation and found analytical solutions of the phase
velocities for a sinusoidal initial state, in a periodic and bounded domain.
Next we made a numerical model of the (BRWE), where we made two different
version, one using forward differences and a second using central differences.
We did an extensive stability analysis of both version, which revealed the
forward difference version be unconditionally unstable, for any combination of
step sizes and time steps. For the central difference version we found it be
stable for $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} < k^2$. 

The model result agreed quite well with the analytical phase velocities for the
sinusoidal initial, where waves propagated westward with constant
phase velocities. We also did model runs with a gaussian initial states, with
varying spread $\sigma$. The phase speed of the Rossby waves with gaussian
initial states was not constant in time, however the waves with large $\sigma$
seemed to have a more constant behaviour.
