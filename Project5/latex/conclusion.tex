\section{Conclusion}
In this study we examined the barotropic rossby wave equation (BRWE) in one and
two dimensions, first we derived
the barotropic wave equation and found analytical expressions of the phase
speed for a sinusoidal initial state, in a periodic and bounded domain.
Next we made a numerical model of the (BRWE), where we made two different
version, one using forward differences and a second using central differences.
We did an extensive stability analysis of both version, which revealed the
forward difference version to be unconditionally unstable, for any combination of
step sizes and time steps. For the central difference version we found it to be
stable for $\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} < k^2$.

The phase velocity of modelled waves $c_{\mathrm{periodic}}= - 0.00625$ and
$c_{\mathrm{closed}} = - 0.0125$ agreed quite well with the analytical phase
velocities, $c_{\mathrm{periodic}} = -0.0063$ and $c_{\mathrm{closed}} =
-0.012665$ for the
sinusoidal initial state, where waves propagated westward with constant
phase velocities. We also did model runs with a gaussian initial state, with
varying $\sigma$. The phase speed of the Rossby waves with gaussian
initial states was not constant in time, however the waves with large $\sigma$
seemed to have a more constant behaviour.
