\section*{Abstract}
This work investigates solutions of the barotropic Rossby wave equation (BRWE)
in a closed and periodic domain, using finite difference methods. First we
derived the BRWE  by linearising the barotropic vorticity equation and
then we scaled this linearised equation to obtain dimensionless analytical
values for the phase speed in one dimension $c_{\mathrm{periodic}} = -0.0063$,
$c_{\mathrm{closed}} = -0.012665$, both with sinusoidal initial states. 
Next we developed an algorithm for solving the BRWE, which we implemented using
both forward time centered space (FTCS) and centered time centered space (CTCS).
For both versions we did an extensive stability analysis and found FTCS to be
unconditionally unstable for all combination of $\Delta x, \Delta t$. CTCS was
found to be stable for $\Delta x / \Delta t < k^2$. Using CTCS version we
obtained $c_{\mathrm{periodic}}= - 0.00625$ and $c_{\mathrm{closed}} = -
0.0125$.
