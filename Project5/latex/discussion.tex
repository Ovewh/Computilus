\section{Discussion}

Our numerical model managed to accurately reproduce the analytical value of the
phase speed for the barotropic Rossby waves with sinusoidal initial state.
Extending our model to two dimension did not give more insight compared to
 one dimension, due to the limitation with the $\beta$-plane approximation, by
which we assume the Coriolis parameter to vary linearly around a reference
latitude. Consequently as we more father from the reference latitude the error
we are making becomes larger. 

Then making implications on the behaviour real 
observed Rossby waves are problematic due to our very simplified model. In fact
by assuming the flow to be barotropic, we neglect the main driver of
motion in the atmosphere/ocean, specifically the poleward
temperature gradient. Still, in the end the purpose of using simplified models
is not to create an accurate representation of reality, it should rather a be
considered a tool for building our physical intuition. This intuition is
invaluable when adding complexity to the model, because the simple models can
work as a baseline for evaluating of the effects of added complexity.
Additions to our model that would be a interesting to follow up on, would be for
example to include a mean flow, that would make our model more representative of
Rossby waves in the atmosphere, where the westerlies greatly influences the
direction of the waves.
