\section*{Abstract}
The Ising model is one of the most studied models in statistical mechanics. In
this work we look at a classic application of the Ising model, namely
the study of phase transitions in magnetic systems.
We implement the a stochastic Monte Carlo model of the Ising model following the
Metropolis algorithm. We ran our model for several temperatures and grid
sizes and calculated the critical temperature for each grid. Then we use a
simple linear regression model to fit a line to the previously calculated
critical temperatures. From the regression line we estimate the critical
temperature for an infinite grid. Our result of $T_C(L=\infty)=2.2687$ are close
to the analytical result of Lars Onsager \parencite{Lars1944} with a relative error of \num{2.00e-4}.
