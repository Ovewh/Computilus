\section*{Abstract}

We implement the Ising model and run simulations using Monte Carlo sampling
and the Metropolis algorithm to estimate the critical temperature of a magnetic
system.
Our result of $T_C(L=\infty)=2.2687$ are close to the analytical result of Lars
Onsager with a relative error of \num{2.00e-4}.
