\section{Discussion}

The values for the confidence intervals around the T$_c$(L=$\infty$) assumes
that the values for T$_c$(L) are certain. This is not correct, since we
introduce uncertainties when running the simulations and by the method we use to
estimate T$_c$(L). We tried two other methods for estimating the temperature
that showed the highest critical temperature. 1. Selecting the 3-5 largest
points. 2. Taking a rolling mean with a window of 3-5. This gave similar results
for T$_c$(L) and T$_C(L=\infty)$, but was more cumbersome to implement than
fitting the polynomial.
