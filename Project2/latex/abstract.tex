\section*{Abstract}
We investigate high-level approaches to increasing the speed of python code
using Numba and Cython, using an implementation of Jacobis method for finding
eigenvalues as a benchmark. The results are also compared to an c++
implementation using armadillo. We show that python code containing heavy use of
loops can gain a considerable speed up by using Numba and Cython, with Numba
requiring the least amount of effort.
