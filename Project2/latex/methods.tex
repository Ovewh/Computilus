Considering the one dimensional wave function
\begin{equation}
\gamma \frac{d^2 u(x)}{dx^2} = -F u(x)
\end{equation}
, with u(x) being the vertical displacement of a beam in the y direction.
x $\in [0, L]$, with L being the length of the beam. $\gamma$ is a material constant,
and F is a force towards the origin being applied at the right hand side of the beam.
We will use the boundary conditions u(0) = u(L) = 0, meaning the beam doesn't move
at the end points.


Since we want to solve this equation numerically we scale it.

Introducing $ \rho = \frac{x}{L} $ limits $\rho$ to $[0, 1]$ and scales the
equation to
$$\frac{d^2 u(\rho)}{d\rho^2} = - \frac{FL^2}{\gamma} u(\rho) = -\lambda u(\rho).$$

This equation can be discretised by ....
