\section*{Introduction}

High-level programming languages like Python and Matlab are popular in
scientific community. High-level syntax allow to write readable code which
closely resembles the mathematics. Combined with excellent and easy to use tools
for plotting, and well developed mathematics libraries makes these languages the
primary programming languages among many scientist. Still for performance
critical computations the shear  c++ or Fortran  

Implement the Jacobi method in c++, python, python with numba and cython.

Compare run time of Jacobi method with armadillos function for finding eigenvalues (eigsys).

Compare run times of the implementations.

Brief overview of numba and cython. The Jacobi method.
