\subsection*{Iterative method}

\textbf{NOTES}

Want to solve:

\begin{equation}
    A\bvec{x} = \bvec{b}
\end{equation}

An Iterative process yields a solution $\bvec{x}$ of an linear system of
equations after infinite number of steps. The idea behind an iterative method is
to create a sequence of vectors $x$ that converge.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:converge}
    x = \lim_{k \to \infty} x^{(k)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{What we are doing}

Implement the Jacobi method in c++, python, python with numba and cython.

Compare run time of Jacobi method with armadillos function for finding eigenvalues (eigsys).

Compare run times of the implementations.

Brief overview of numba and cython. The Jacobi method.
