\section*{Abstract}
This work demonstrates the advantages of thinking and understanding the problem
before hand, instead of right away computationally brute forcing a solution. For
our demonstration we 
solved the one dimensional Poisson's equation using tree different algorithms
, LU-decomposition, the general tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) or the
Thomas algorithm \cite{tridia} and a specialized TDMA.
We used the LU-decomposition algorithm to illustrate the brute force solution.
By thinking before hand and creating a specialized TDMA for our problem, we
experienced a speed up 
of around 80000 compared to using the general LU-decomposition. For large
matrices the general LU-decomposition also faced memory constraints. Our
specialized TDMA also showed an increase of around 2.2 in performance compared to the general TDMA.
