\section*{Abstract}
This work demonstrates the necessity of understanding the problem
before hand when doing numerical problem solving, and the consequence of right
away opting for a brute force a solution. To demonstrate we solved the one
dimensional
Poisson's equation using tree different algorithms
, LU-decomposition, the general tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) or the
Thomas algorithm \cite{tridia} and a specialized TDMA.
We used the LU-decomposition algorithm to illustrate a brute force solution.
From understanding our problem before hand, we developed a specialized TDMA for
our problem. The specialized TDMA was about
80000 times faster compared to the general LU-decomposition. For large
matrices the general LU-decomposition also faced memory constraints. Our
specialized TDMA also showed an increase of around 2.2 in performance compared to the general TDMA.
