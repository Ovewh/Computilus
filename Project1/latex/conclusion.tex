\section*{Summary}

By understanding the problem we were able to simplify the
calculations leading to speedups of the order $10^5$ and the ability to achieve
significantly higher numerical precision by reducing the memory
needed for the calculations, thus allowing us to use smaller stepsizes.
We expect that increasing the step size beyond $10^{-7}$ will lead to round off
errors and increases in the relative error, but were not able to confirm this.
All the code used in this project is available on github \cite{github}.
