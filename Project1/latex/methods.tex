\section*{Methods} 
Building upon the previously described concepts of numerical derivatives
discussed earlier, we will now describe how to solve our differential
equation \cref{eq:2}  numerically by rewriting it as a set of linear equations.
\par
Explicitly, we will solve the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  -u''(x) = f(x), \quad x \in (0,1), \quad u(0)=u(1)=0 
\end{equation*} 
So wri
we will begin outlining how to solve our second order differential
equation \cref{eq:2}. \par We will continue with the equation for the
second order derivate \cref{eq:secondorder}, which we will write in a shorthand
notation. \begin{equation}
  f'' \approx \frac{f_{i-1} - 2f + f_{i+1}}{h^2}
\end{equation}
