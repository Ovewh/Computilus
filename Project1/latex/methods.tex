\subsection*{Numerical differentiation}
%NOTE THIS MAY END UP IN INTRODUCTION  
\par Computers operate in discrete steps, which means that variables are stored as discrete variables. For a discrete variable over a particular range there is a minimum step length between each value that variable can take in that range. Compared to a continuous variable which can take on any value in that particular range. The step length $h$ can either be set manually or it can be determined based on the start and end point of our particular range, $h = \frac{x_n -x_0}{n}$. Where $n$ is the number of points we choose to have in our range. The shorter the step length in the discrete variable the better it will approximate the continuous variable.  
\par
The simplest ways to compute the derivate numerically is to use what is called forward difference method eq.(\ref{eq:1}) or equivalently backward difference method (eq.\ref{eq:5}). We also see that if we include the limit $\lim_{h\to 0}$ we obtain the definition of the derivate. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
    f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
  f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x-h)+f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
Since numerical differentiation always will give an approximation of the derivate, we would like to quantify our error. The error can be derived if we do a taylor series expansion of the $f(x+h)$ term in around $x$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
    f(x+h) = f(x) + h'f(x) + \frac{h^2f''(x)}{2} + \frac{h^3f'''(x)}{6} + \dots    
\end{equation}   
If we next insert this taylor expansion into eq.(\ref{eq:4}) we get:
\begin{equation}
  f'(x) = f'(x) + \frac{h f''(x)}{2} + \frac{h^2f'''(x)}{6} + \dots
\end{equation} 
Our approximation of the derivate includes $f'(x)$ and some terms which are proportional to $h, h^2, h^3 \dots $ and since $h$ is assumed to be small the $h$ terms would dominate. The error is said to be of the order $h$. 
\par
To get a numerical scheme for the second derivate we would just take the derivate of eq. \ref{eq:1}. 
\begin{equation}
  f''(x) \approx \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
