\section*{Methods} 
Building upon the previously described concepts of numerical derivatives, we will now describe how to solve our differential
equation \cref{eq:2}  numerically by rewriting it as a set of linear equations.
\par
Explicitly, we will solve the differential equation:
\begin{equation*}
  -u''(x) = f(x), \quad x \in (0,1), \quad u(0)=u(1)=0 
\end{equation*} 
We will define the discrete approximation to $u(x)$ as $v_i$ with grid points
$x_i = ih$ in the range from $x_0 = 0$ to $x_{n +1} = 1$, and the step length is
defined as $h = 1/(n+1)$. The boundary conditions is $v_0 = 0$ and 
$v_{n+1} = 0$. The second derivate we approximate according to
\cref{eq:secondorder} and also introducing the shorthand notation we get \cref{eq:2ndordshort}.  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2ndordshort}
  g_i = -\frac{v_{i-1}-2v_i + v_{i+1}}{h^2} \quad \mathrm{for} \; i = 1,2,3 \dots , n
\end{equation}  
To see how \cref{eq:2ndordshort} can be represented as matrix equation, we will
first multiply each side by $h^2$.
\begin{equation*}
  v_{i-1} -2v_{i} + v_{i+1} = g_i h^2, \quad  \tilde{g}_i = g_i h^2
\end{equation*} 
Next we represent the $v_i$'s and the $\tilde{g}_i$'s as a vectors,
\begin{equation*}
  \bvec{v} = \left[v_1, v_2, v_3 ,\dots, v_{n}\right], \quad 
  \bvec{\tilde{g}} = \left[\tilde{g}_1,, \tilde{g}_2, \tilde{g}_3,
  \dots, \tilde{g}_{n} \right]
\end{equation*}  
Then if we transpose our two vectors we only need to find the $n\times n$ matrix
$\bvec{A}$ and our matrix equation is complete. The matrix $\bvec{A}$ would in
our case look like this.
\begin{equation*}
  \bvec{A} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 &\dots & 0 \\
     1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & \dots & 0  \\
     \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
     0 & \dots & & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
     0 & \dots & & 0 & -1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
It is easy to verify that $\bvec{A} v = \bvec{\tilde{g}}$ would give us 
\cref{eq:2ndordshort}, simply by doing the matrix multiplication. The matrix $\bvec{A}$ has some
particular nice features, primarily it a tridiagonal matrix which means that we
can use the efficient Thomas Algorithm to solve our linear system of equation,
secondly it has constant values along the diagonals, which we'll exploit later.    
\subsection*{Thomas Algorithm}
The Thomas Algorithm quite straight forward to implement and based on the more
general LU decomposition. The full implementation of the Thomas algorithm can be
found on our
github\footnote{https://github.com/Ovewh/Computilus/tree/master/Project1/src/linalg.py}
here we will just outline the general idea. \par Just a the
