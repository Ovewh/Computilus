\section*{Methods}
Building upon concepts of numerical derivatives discussed earlier
we will begin outlining how to solve our second order differential
equation \cref{eq:2}. \par We will continue with the equation for the
second order derivate \cref{eq:secondorder}, which we will write in a shorthand
notation. \begin{equation}
  f'' \approx \frac{f_{i-1} - 2f + f_{i+1}}{h^2}
\end{equation}
